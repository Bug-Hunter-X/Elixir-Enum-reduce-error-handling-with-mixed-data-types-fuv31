The following Elixir code attempts to use the `Enum.reduce` function to sum a list of numbers, but it contains a subtle error that can lead to unexpected results. 

```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

sum = Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc -> x + acc end)

IO.puts(sum)  # Output: 15
```

This code works correctly, however, if we change the list to include a non-number:

```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, "a", 4, 5]

sum = Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc -> x + acc end)

IO.puts(sum)  # Output: **Error**
```

The error arises because the `+` operator is not defined for a string and an integer.
